# Archive Directory

This directory contains archived files for historical reference.

## Files

- `clockify_support_cli_final.py.bak_v41` - CLI snapshot from v4.1 release, retained for reference during major refactorings

## Purpose

Historical artifacts are moved here to:
1. Keep the repository root clean and focused on active development
2. Preserve important snapshots for comparison and rollback if needed
3. Make it clear which files are legacy vs. current

## Guidelines

- Files in this directory should not be imported or executed
- Consider removing files older than 2 releases unless they serve a specific reference purpose
- Document the reason for archiving in commit messages
